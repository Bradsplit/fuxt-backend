# stackhaus backend

A [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) template that turns it into a headless CMS API powered by [WP Graph QL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/). We use it to power a Vue/Nuxt frontend. The boilerplate for that is called [Stackhaus](https://github.com/funkhaus/stackhaus). Built by [Funkhaus](http://funkhaus.us/).

## Install

1.  Install theme
1.  Install required plugins as prompted
1.  Re-save Permalinks
1.  If using ACF, it is strongly recommended to import the ACF fields in the `.json` file from `/acf/` directory.

## Wordpress config

### Permalinks

Won't work with default setting. Must have pretty permalinks enabled.

## TODO

-   Document how to use shortcodes
