# stackhaus backend

A [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) theme that turns it into a headless CMS API powered by [WP Graph QL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/). We use it to power a Vue/Nuxt frontend. The boilerplate for that is called [Stackhaus](https://github.com/funkhaus/stackhaus). Built by [Funkhaus](http://funkhaus.us/).

## Install

1.  Install theme
1.  Install required plugins as prompted
    1.  If you want to use ACF, there are some default fields we recommend, you can find the file to import from the theme directory `/acf/` or [here](https://github.com/funkhaus/stackhaus-backend/tree/master/acf).
1.  Re-save Permalinks
1.  If using ACF, it is strongly recommended to import the ACF fields in the `.json` file from `/acf/` directory.

## More

Please see the documentation for [Stackhaus](https://github.com/funkhaus/stackhaus) to better understand what this theme can do!

## TODO
